# **Instagram Guinness Advisor Data Extraction, Geocoding & Visualisation** 
This is a project that demonstrates how to scrape and analyse Instagram data using Apify, Python, and Google Maps API, and then visualize it using Tableau. The project involves scraping Instagram data from a specific profile, data cleansing, data enriching, geocoding and data visualisation.

# Prerequisites ðŸ’»
To run the this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Apify account
- Google Maps API key
- Tableau Desktop

Packages

```python 
import pandas as pd
import regex as re
from rich import print
from rich.pretty import pprint
import requests
import logging
import time
```

# Getting Started ðŸ› 
To run the Python files in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.
3. Place the Apify output file (instagram_guinnessadvisor.xlsx) in the project directory.
4. Run the following command to clean the resulting data:

    **main.py**

5. Run the following command to geocode the address field

     **geocode.py**

6. Run the following command to join the cleaned data with the geocode data and produce a geocoded output file:

    **join.py**

The resulting file (final_instagram_guinnessadvisor_geocoded.xlsx) can be used for data visualization in Tableau or other similar visualtion tools.

# Data Extraction ðŸ”‘
The Apify application was used to extract Instagram posts tagged with the hashtag #GuinnessAdvisor. The extracted data included the post's caption, date, and location, as well as the number of likes and comments.

# Data Cleaning ðŸ§¼
The extracted data was cleaned using Python's Pandas library to remove any duplicate posts, and to reformat the date and time columns for easier analysis.

# Geocoding ðŸ—º
The original data was also joined with geocoded addresses using Python's Pandas library. The geocoded data was then exported to a new file, ready for data visualization in Tableau or Power BI.

# Data Analysis ðŸ“Š
The cleaned data was then loaded into Tableau, where a dashboard was created to analyze the data. The dashboard included visualizations of the total number of posts, likes, and comments, as well as the top ratings and locations.


# Files
The following files were used in this project:

- extract.py: Python script for extracting data from Instagram using the Apify application
- clean.py: Python script for cleaning the extracted data using Pandas
- join.py: Python script for joining the cleaned data with geocoded addresses using Pandas
- final_instagram_guinnessadvisor.xlsx: The final cleaned data file
- final_instagram_guinnessadvisor_geocoded.xlsx: The final geocoded data file
- geocode_addresses.xlsx: The geocoded addresses file
- Instagram Guinness Advisor Dashboard.twbx: The Tableau dashboard file

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Python and Tableau in extracting and analyzing data from social media platforms. By using these tools, we were able to extract valuable information from Instagram and present it in an easy-to-understand format through data visualization.
